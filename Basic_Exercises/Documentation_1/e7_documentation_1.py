# What happens if we take the list ['fish', 'and', 'chips'] and try to access 
# the element at index position 10? First try to determine what will happen by 
# consulting the documentation, then verify your understanding in the Python REPL.



my_list = ['fish', 'and', 'chips']

# This is not in the documentation, but you will get an IndexError: list out of range
